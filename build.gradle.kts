 * The config "idea" represents all changes to settings that IntelliJ needs to build, run and debug
 * XTC code. It also provides sample configurations for a debuggable HelloWorld.x program with a
 * breakpoint, as well as a configuration that can be used to debug and/or testÂ§ the build process
 * with breakpoints.
 *
 * The goal with this configuration is to make it unnecessary to ever manually change or add
 * settings in IntelliJ for a fully configured "get started immediately" dev environment for XTC.
 * This will soon be complemented by a complete language plugin for XTC, which will ingrate
 * IntelliJ with XTC development. This should include IntelliJ debugger support, language analysis,
 * and a dependency for requesting and installing the correct XDK binary artifact from a repository.
 * When complete, a new potential XTC developer need only create a new Gradle project and add the XVM
 * as a dependency to the xtc-language-plugin (the language plugin will also provide an auto generate
 * templates for both the Gradle build file and the needed XDK dependency). Futhermore, the XTC
 * compiler, and most of the stuff in Java tools will also be integrated with the IDE. For example,
 * lazy compilation requests for new source code, if it has not been built, just like Java in
 * IntelliJ works today.
 *
 * It should now be possible to add a simple .x suffixed source code snippet to the project, modify the
 * already imported Run/Debug Configuration to execute the file. write a small ".x" source code file
 * and add it to the project in the .idea directory. Right now, the current master branch shouldn't
 * need any more configuration than what is given below. The configuration also provides a
 * simple HelloWorld.x program and a breakpoint, so that just by executing it in Debug Mode will
 * bootstrap the system and leave the user in the debugger at the predefined breakpoint.
 *
 * The IDEA andIDEA.ext plugin have predefined sections:
 *    + module settings (extended by ext plugin)
 *    + project settings (extended by ext plugin)
 *    + workspace settings (likely not needed with .idea directory format, and handover to IntelliJ with the ext plugin)
 *
 * We might have to handle raw XML to do things like setting predefined breakpoints and so on.
 * Most of the time, it's enough to mess around with the xml files in the .idea folder. However, some of the
 * state, which seems it should belong there, is derived from other places in the file system. As there is
 * no clear boundary, it is confusing. Here are the system paths that IntelliJ also uses to recreate
